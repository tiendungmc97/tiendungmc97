Hello ðŸ‘‹!
I'm Dung, a front-end developer with 4+ years of experience specializing in creating detailed design specifications and developing scalable, high-performance web applications. 
My expertise spans across technologies like ReactJS, NextJS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on optimizing user experiences and maintaining clean, well-documented code. I thrive in collaborative environments but am equally comfortable leading projects independently.
